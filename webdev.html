            <p>I'm a passionate web developer with over a year of hands-on experience in front-end development. My journey began with a transformative 7-month boot camp, where I dove into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more. Armed with this knowledge, I've crafted engaging websites using Squarespace and Shopify, ensuring they are both functional and visually stunning.

                From managing code with Git and GitHub to integrating Firebase and Node.js for dynamic applications, I thrive on bringing ideas to life through clean, responsive design. Whether you're looking to build a new site from scratch or enhance an existing one, I’m here to turn your vision into a reality with a touch of creativity and a lot of technical expertise.</p>

                <p class="screenshot-caption">Feed is a recipe website I created entirely from scratch, using React for a smooth and interactive user experience. The site allows users to browse and save their favorite recipes, with all data securely stored in Firebase. From designing the layout to coding the functionality, I handled every aspect of the project. The result is a clean, user-friendly interface that makes cooking more enjoyable and discovering new dishes a breeze.</p>

                <p class="screenshot-caption">I built an online store using React, focusing on creating a seamless shopping experience. The site features a clean design and intuitive navigation, making it easy for users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases. Every aspect, from the product displays to the checkout process, was carefully crafted to ensure a smooth, user-friendly experience.</p>

                <p class="screenshot-caption">I developed a photography contest website using JavaScript, designed to provide photographers a platform to showcase their work and engage in competition. The site features intuitive navigation for easy submission of entries and viewing past submissions. With a focus on user experience, the interface is clean and minimalistic, highlighting the stunning visuals of the photography. This project combines technical functionality with artistic display, offering a vibrant community for photographers to connect and display their art.</p>

                <p class="screenshot-caption">I created a random TV show generator, a web project designed to spice up your viewing choices with a bit of serendipity. Built with sleek, responsive design, this site uses JavaScript to randomly select a TV show from a vast database, presenting users with the show's title, a brief synopsis, and an image. It's perfect for those evenings when you just can't decide what to watch—let Showpic make the choice and discover something new!</p>
